In the last few weeks, I kept hearing about this new browser called Arc. 
I was curious, so I decided to give it a try after I finally got an invite. 
I've been using it for a few days now, and I have some thoughts on it. 
I'm not going to go into the technical details of the browser, but I will share my thoughts on the browser from the perspective of a developer.

## The Good parts of Arc
I just love the design of Arc. It's simple, but it's also very elegant and usable.

### The website panel
Since most websites organize their content vertically, it is just amazing that Arc gives them the full height of the screen.
It just makes the browser feels immersive and a bit different, which I like.

### The sidebar
I've never used a browser with a sidebar before, but I really like it.
You can actually read the titles of the tabs, and it's just way easier to keep everything organized for some reason.
I actually use bookmarks now, which I never did before.
Additionally, the difference between the quick bookmarks at the top (the icon grid) and the bookmarks below is a great way to organize your bookmarks.
You can add folders with links to all dev environments to the named bookmark list, and you can add often used sites to the icon grid.

### The dev bar

When I first saw the dev bar, I was blown away.
It might sound stupid, but it is just such a nice touch and it makes the browser feel so much more polished.
I think the team did a great job catering to developers with this amazing little feature.

Additionally, the dev bar fixes certain issues of Arc that developers might have.
For example, the dev bar displays the full URL instead of the domain name, which is great for debugging.
It also features shortcuts to the important dev tools panels like Elements, Network, and of course the Console.

### Spaces and profiles
bit confusing at first, but handy
Colors are fun
Icons are fun


#### The screenshot tool
I haven't used the screenshot tool that much yet, but it's a great feature to have.
It is pretty basic, but it makes it easy to take a screenshot of a certain element/container. 
It automatically snaps to elements on the website when moving around with your cursor.

### The Bad parts of Arc
Extensions can't be pinned (password manager annoying)
performance isn't great (yet hopefully), download panel is slow to load
invite-only :(

### Some ideas
ngrok/proxy integration for the dev bar
just let us pin the password manager (recurring joke)
web apps sometimes freeze when they're open for a long time, reloading doens't fix the issue
